			Getting Around the Ship

			<p>There are interactive maps near all of the elevators. However, interactive maps are slow, so if you can learn some basics of ship navigation, you will be much faster.</p>
			<ul style="list-style: disc; padding-left: 10px">
				<li>Facing Fore, Port is Left. Starboard is Right. Port has the same number of letters as Left. Right and Starboard have more letters than Left and Port.</li>
				<li>Look at the hundreds place of room numbers. If it’s 4 or lower, you are in a Starboard corridor. If it’s 5 or higher, you are in a Port corridor.</li>
				<li>In some cases, you might be in an aft-most area, or an offshoot hallway. You’ll probably know if you’re in one of these places or not.</li>
				<li>Room numbers get larger the farther Aft you are, smaller the farther Fore you are.</li>
				<li>Even number rooms are exterior. Odd number rooms are interior.</li>
				<li>Pay attention to the art in the stairwells, and note which are fore and which are aft.</li>
				<li>Maps in the hallways are always oriented to the direction of the ship.</li>
