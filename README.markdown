CruiseMonkey
============

CruiseMonkey is an HTML5 app for use on [JoCo Cruise Crazy](http://jococruisecrazy.com/).  It was designed to be used while on the cruise for viewing and organizing events, getting information about the ship, and more.

Beta Testing
============

Android
-------

Android has no limitations on who can install apps from outside the app store.  The latest release is always available from [the CruiseMonkey GitHub site](https://github.com/RangerRick/CruiseMonkey/releases/).

iOS
---

If you wish to beta test CruiseMonkey on iOS, you must sign up for a [TestFlight](http://testflightapp.com) account.

1. Sign up at [testflightapp.com](http://testflightapp.com).
2. Register your device by browsing to [testflightapp.com](http://testflightapp.com) directly on your mobile device.  It will prompt for a login (if you haven't already) and then register a certificate profile with your device which allows pushing beta releases to your device.
3. Go to the [CruiseMonkey beta recruitment page](http://tflig.ht/ytVfRp) and apply as a tester.

Returning Beta Testers - Action Required!
-----------------------------------------

Apple only allows a certain number of approved devices to be built into test binaries.  This means that I have a limited number of test slots available.  Rather than adding to last year's beta list, I'm starting over this year, since it's possible that some of last year's testers have bought or gotten rid of devices or will not be attending JCCC4.

If you have beta tested previous CruiseMonkey releases, **please email me at [testflight@raccoonfink.com](mailto:testflight@raccoonfink.com)** to let me know your TestFlight account email address and which device(s) are still active and that you would like to test again this year.

Bugs and Enhancement Requests
=============================

Known Issues
------------

* Login is not working on Android yet.  CruiseMonkey will be stuck in read-only mode for now.
* Sometimes it is possible to drag the app in a way that causes the "main" window to stay stuck out of alignment.

Opening an Issue (Bug or Enhancement)
-------------------------------------

Bugs and enhancement requests can be reported at the [CruiseMonkey github page](https://github.com/RangerRick/CruiseMonkey/issues).  You will need to create a GitHub account to do so.
