Twit-Arr
========

CruiseMonkey works just fine in read-only mode, but if you want to be able to create and favorite events, as well as use some of the other features for CruiseMonkey, you must log in with a twit-arr account [on the new Twit-Arr server first!](https://jccc5.rylath.net/)

If you have any issues with the twit-arr server, I can't really help you.  Please ask Kvort\_the\_Duck on the JoCo forums, or post to the [twit-arr beta thread][].  Or, feel free to join us on IRC in #twitarr on irc.freenode.net.

Beta Testing
============

* Android (Google Play): [join the CruiseMonkey Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cruisemonkey), and then once you're approved, [follow this link](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.raccoonfink.cruisemonkey) to opt-in to alpha/beta testing.
* iOS: [email me](mailto:cruisemonkey@raccoonfink.com) and I will send you an invite for iOS testing.  The limit for testers is now 1000 users, so there is no worry about having too many this year!
