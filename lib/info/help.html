				Getting Around the Ship
			</div>
			<div class="item item-text-wrap">
				<p>There are interactive maps near all of the elevators. However, interactive maps are slow, so if you can learn some basics of ship navigation, you will be much faster.</p>
				<ul style="list-style: disc; padding-left: 10px">
					<li>Go through the mall instead of the casino to get to Studio B (a.k.a. Ice Rink)</li>
					<li>Fore is the front of the ship when moving foreward.  Most entertainment, game room / Sea Monkey Central, lounges, and Spa/Fitness Center are to the fore of the ship.</li>
					<li>Aft is the rear of the ship, or what comes after the ship has passed. The ocean flows aft.  Dining, Studio B, business/study services, limited-access clubs, simulated outdoor experiences, Concierge Club, and the Champagne Bar are aft.</li>
					<li>Getting from Fore to Aft is best done:
						<ul style="list-style: disc; padding-left: 10px">
							<li>Indoors levels 5-10. 5 through the Promenade. 6-10 through port and starboard passages past the staterooms.</li>
							<li>Outdoors 11-12 or the exterior promenades on 4.</li>
							<li>If you don’t mind smoke, you can go indoors level 4 through the casino.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Facing Fore, Port is Left. Starboard is Right. Port has the same number of letters as Left. Right and Starboard have more letters than Left and Port.</li>
					<li>Look at the hundreds place of room numbers.
						<ul style="list-style: disc; padding-left: 10px">
							<li>If it’s below 5, you are in a Starboard corridor.</li>
							<li>If it’s above 4, you are in a Port corridor.</li>
							<li>In some cases, you might be in an aft-most area, or an offshoot hallway. You’ll probably know if you’re in one of these places or not.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Room numbers get larger the farther Aft you are, smaller the farther Fore you are.</li>
					<li>Even number rooms are exterior. Odd number rooms are interior.</li>
					<li>Pay attention to the art in the stairwells, and note which are fore and which are aft.</li>
					<li>Maps in the hallways are always oriented to the direction of the ship.</li>
