{"name":"Cruisemonkey","tagline":"CruiseMonkey Source Code","body":"[![Stories in Ready](https://badge.waffle.io/RangerRick/CruiseMonkey.png?label=ready&title=Ready)](https://waffle.io/RangerRick/CruiseMonkey)\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/RangerRick/CruiseMonkey.png)](https://travis-ci.org/RangerRick/CruiseMonkey)\r\n\r\nCruiseMonkey\r\n============\r\n\r\nCruiseMonkey is an HTML5 app for use on [JoCo Cruise Crazy](http://jococruisecrazy.com/).  It is designed to be used while on the cruise for viewing and organizing events, getting information about the ship, and more.\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n============\r\n\r\n* iOS: Any device supporting iOS 6 or higher\r\n* Android: Any device supporting Android 4.0.3 or higher\r\n* Web: A browser capable of modern HTML5\r\n\r\nDownload\r\n========\r\n\r\nThe latest release version of CruiseMonkey is available in the following app stores:\r\n\r\n* [iOS App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cruisemonkey/id597303284?mt=8)\r\n* [Amazon Apps for Android](http://www.amazon.com/Benjamin-Reed-CruiseMonkey/dp/B00BBOMRDW)\r\n* [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.raccoonfink.cruisemonkey&hl=en_GB)\r\n\r\nTwit-Arr\r\n========\r\n\r\nCruiseMonkey works just fine in read-only mode, but if you want to be able to create and favorite events, as well as use some of the other features for CruiseMonkey, you must log in with a twit-arr account [on my test Twit-Arr server first!](https://cm.raccoonfink.com/)\r\n\r\nBeta Testing\r\n============\r\n\r\n* Android (Google Play): Just follow [this link to opt-in to betas](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.raccoonfink.cruisemonkey) on the Google Play store.\r\n* iOS: [email me](mailto:cruisemonkey@raccoonfink.com) and I will send you an invite for iOS testing.  The limit for testers is now 2000 users, so there is no worry about having too many this year!\r\n\r\nBugs and Enhancement Requests\r\n=============================\r\n\r\nOpening an Issue (Bug or Enhancement)\r\n-------------------------------------\r\n\r\n* Twit-Arr: If you have found a bug or have an enhancement request for twit-arr, report it at the [Twit-Arr github page](https://github.com/walkeriniraq/twitarr/issues).  You will need to create a GitHub account to do so.\r\n* CruiseMonkey: Bugs and enhancement requests can be reported at the [CruiseMonkey github page](https://github.com/RangerRick/CruiseMonkey/issues).  You will need to create a GitHub account to do so.\r\n\r\nQuick-Start Developing\r\n==========\r\n\r\nPre-reqs\r\n--------\r\n\r\nBefore you can build CruiseMonkey, you must first install [Node.JS](http://nodejs.org/).  Once you have done that, run the following commands to set up your environment:\r\n\r\n1. Install \"global\" commands through NPM: `npm install -g ionic cordova bower webpack webpack-cli`\r\n1. Install local node requirements through NPM: `npm install`\r\n1. Install JavaScript browser requirements through Bower: `bower install`\r\n1. Set up one or more platforms: `cordova platform add browser` -- see `cordova platform` for all platforms you can add.  You will need to add any platforms to which you wish to target\r\n\r\nCompiling the Javascript\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\n* To compile the JavaScript once, run: `npm run build`\r\n* To continuously compile the JavaScript as you edit: `npm run watch`\r\n\r\nStarting a browser session for this project\r\n--------------------------------------------\r\n1. Ensure [Twit-arr](https://github.com/walkeriniraq/twitarr) is running as well as MongoDb for it\r\n1. `ionic run browser`\r\n  * you can exchange browser for the platform of your choice\r\n\r\nStarting an Emulator\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\n* Android: `npm run android`\r\n* iOS: `npm run ios`\r\n\r\nNote that if you run `npm run watch` in one window and then start the emulator in another, you can live-edit code and it will auto-refresh in the emulator.\r\n\r\nOther Commands\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n* `npm run verbose-build`: Do a \"verbose\" webpack build, which can give more information on what is being done during compilation.\r\n* `npm run genymotion`: Run the Android build in the Genymotion emulator rather than the (slower) Android emulator.  (Requires a Genymotion installation.)\r\n* `npm run release`: Run webpack and build in release mode.  This makes a smaller, faster build with unreadable JavaScript.\r\n\r\nContact\r\n=======\r\n\r\n* E-Mail: You can reach me (Benjamin Reed) at [cruisemonkey@raccoonfink.com](mailto:cruisemonkey@raccoonfink.com).\r\n* Slack: Join us in #twitarr and #cruisemonkey on [Slack](http://cm.raccoonfink.com/slack/).\r\n* Forums: You can also discuss CruiseMonkey on the [JoCo Forums](http://www.jonathancoulton.com/forums/index.php?p=/discussion/2448/twit-arr-and-cruisemonkey-2016).\r\n\r\nLicensing\r\n=========\r\n\r\nCruiseMonkey by Benjamin Reed is licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).\r\n![](http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/4.0/88x31.png \"Creative Commons by-nc-sa\")\r\n\r\nRelease Notes\r\n=============\r\n\r\nThe release notes can now be found [here](CHANGELOG.md).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
